## Running Tests

### Using the Test Runner Script

The recommended way to run memory validation tests is using the provided test runner script:

```bash
# Run all memory validation tests
python scripts/run_memory_validation_tests.py

# Run specific test class
python scripts/run_memory_validation_tests.py --test-class data_migration
python scripts/run_memory_validation_tests.py --test-class performance

# Run only performance-related tests
python scripts/run_memory_validation_tests.py --performance-only

# Run only integration tests
python scripts/run_memory_validation_tests.py --integration-only

# Generate detailed report to file
python scripts/run_memory_validation_tests.py --report-file memory_validation_report.txt

# Verbose output for debugging
python scripts/run_memory_validation_tests.py --verbose
```

### Using pytest directly

```bash
# Run all memory migration tests
uv run python -m pytest tests/integration/test_memory_migration.py -v

# Run specific test class
uv run python -m pytest tests/integration/test_memory_migration.py::TestDataMigrationValidation -v

# Run specific test method
uv run python -m pytest tests/integration/test_memory_migration.py::TestPerformanceComparison::test_job_storage_performance_comparison -v

# Run with detailed output
uv run python -m pytest tests/integration/test_memory_migration.py -v -s
```

## Test Categories

### ðŸ”µ Data Migration Tests (`--test-class data_migration`)

Validates the migration from Redis to CrewAI Memory system:

- **Migration script validation**: Tests data conversion accuracy
- **Data integrity checks**: Ensures no data loss during migration
- **Backup functionality**: Validates backup creation and restoration
- **Error recovery**: Tests migration failure scenarios

### ðŸŸ¡ Performance Tests (`--performance-only`)

Benchmarks memory system performance against Redis:

- **Storage/retrieval speed**: Compares operation times
- **Concurrent access performance**: Tests multi-threaded scenarios
- **Memory usage efficiency**: Validates resource consumption
- **Throughput testing**: Measures operations per second

### ðŸŸ¢ Functionality Tests (`--integration-only`)

Tests core memory system operations:

- **Storage interface**: Validates CrewAI Storage implementation
- **Memory persistence**: Tests data persistence across restarts
- **Agent memory**: Validates agent-specific memory operations
- **Search functionality**: Tests memory querying capabilities

### ðŸ”´ Stress Tests (included in concurrent/failover)

Tests system limits and error handling:

- **Concurrent access**: Multi-threaded access patterns
- **Failure scenarios**: Error recovery and failover
- **Resource limits**: Memory exhaustion and disk space
- **Long-running operations**: Extended test scenarios

## Performance Benchmarks

The tests validate that the CrewAI Memory system meets these performance requirements:

### Job Operations

- **Save time**: < 50ms per operation
- **Retrieval time**: < 20ms per operation
- **Throughput**: > 20 operations/second

### Analysis Operations

- **Save time**: < 100ms per operation (larger data)
- **Throughput**: > 10 operations/second

### Concurrent Access

- **Error rate**: < 5% under concurrent load
- **Throughput**: > 50 operations/second with 8 threads

```

### Performance Metrics

The test runner provides detailed performance metrics:

- Average operation times (milliseconds)
- Throughput rates (operations/second)
- Memory usage patterns (MB)
- Success rates (percentage)
- Test execution times (seconds)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Redis Connection Warnings**

   ```
   WARNING: Redis é€£æŽ¥å¤±æ•—: AUTH called without any password configured
   ```

   - This is expected when Redis is not available
   - Tests use fallback mechanisms and mocks

2. **Memory Usage Warnings**

   - Some tests intentionally stress memory limits
   - Temporary high memory usage is expected during testing

3. **Test Timeouts**
   - Performance tests have 5-minute timeouts
   - Concurrent tests may take longer on slower systems

### Debug Mode

For debugging test failures:

```bash
# Run with maximum verbosity
python scripts/run_memory_validation_tests.py --verbose --test-class <failing_class>

# Run single test with pytest debugging
uv run python -m pytest tests/integration/test_memory_migration.py::<TestClass>::<test_method> -v -s --tb=long
```

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests are designed to be integrated into continuous integration pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Run Memory System Validation
  run: |
    python scripts/run_memory_validation_tests.py --report-file memory_report.txt

- name: Upload Test Report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: memory-validation-report
    path: memory_report.txt
```

## Contributing

When adding new memory system features:

1. **Add corresponding tests** to the appropriate test class
2. **Update performance benchmarks** if needed
3. **Run full validation suite** before submitting changes
4. **Update this documentation** for new test scenarios

### Test Development Guidelines

- Use **descriptive test names** that explain the scenario
- **Mock external dependencies** (Redis, file system) when possible
- **Use temporary directories** for all file operations
- **Clean up resources** in teardown methods
- **Assert specific expectations** rather than generic success/failure
- **Include performance assertions** for timing-critical operations
